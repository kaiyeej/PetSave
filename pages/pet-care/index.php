                  <h2>How to take care of your pet
                  </h2>
                  <p class="excert">
                     <strong>Feed your pet/s and give them water on a regular schedule</strong>
                     <br>
                     It is advised that you feed your pets twice every day and allow your dog constant access to water.
                     <br>
                     <strong>Get your pet/s vaccinated</strong>
                     <br>
                     Your veterinarian will advise you on which diseases are common and which ones require vaccination.
                     <br>
                     <strong>Use regular parasite-preventative treatments</strong>
                     <br>
                     It is necessary to treat basic worms on a regular basis. The frequency is determined by your pet's lifestyle.
                     <br>
                     <strong>Keep your dog's coat clean</strong>
                     <br>
                     Dirty coats can cause serious skin infections.
                     <br>
                     <strong>Provide your pets with plenty of exercises</strong>
                     <br>
                     Give your pet the appropriate amount of exercise. Taking them out for a walk will provide physical activity to meet your petâ€™s health and exercise needs.
                     <br>
                     <strong>Socialize your pets</strong>
                     Pets that have been socialized learn how to respond to their environment in a healthy way, without unwarranted fear or hostility.
                     <br>
                     <strong>Make sure your pets have access to a comfortable place to sleep and are not left out in extreme temperatures.</strong>
                     <br>
                     Leaving your pet outside on a hot summer without proper weather protection can cause injury or death. It is preferable to keep your pet inside during inclement weather, but if this is not possible, make sure your pet has access to a good dog house and plenty of water.

                  <h2>Problem with stray animals</h2>
                  <p class="excert">
                     <strong>Road Accidents</strong>
                     <br>
                     When stray animals are left alone, they may cause accidents on the road, resulting in injuries to themselves and other people.
                     <br>
                     <strong>Property Damage</strong>
                     <br>
                     Stray animals are frequently more vicious, unpredictable, and rugged compared to domesticated dogs.
                     <strong>Waste scavenging</strong>
                     Stray animals enjoy opening garbage bags because a lot of us throw our food in the garbage. This can cause problems throughout our environment and ultimately it will affect our health.
                     <br>
                     <strong>Stray animals may have parasites</strong>
                     <br>
                     Stray animals frequently live under sheds, decks, and buildings, where they spread fleas and diseases. 
                     <br>
                     <strong>Some stray animals have aggression</strong>
                     <br>
                     Most stray dogs are not friendly to humans, and an uncontrolled stray dog has the potential to bite someone. <strong>Stray animals may have rabies</strong>
                     <br>
                     They may spread rabies, a dangerous disease that can easily be passed from human to human. Dogs are the most well-known carriers of the disease around the world.
